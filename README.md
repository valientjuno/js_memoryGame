This Memory Game (https://valientjuno.github.io/js_memoryGame/) works by clicking the face down cards to reveal the face.

Only 2 cards may be flipped to match correctly, once matched the cards will stay face-up.

If the cards are matched incorrectly they will return to default.

Once Completed, feel free to refresh the screen to begin a new game shuffle.
